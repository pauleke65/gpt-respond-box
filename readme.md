- **Pre-setup tasks automation** - By automating routine tasks such as scheduling emails, managing follow-ups, and organizing communications, the GPT-Respond-Box enables users to focus on more strategic activities.



## Project Modules
GPT-Respond-Box is composed of the following modules:

- **Order Management** - The Order Management module monitors and processes customer orders, updates their statuses, and sends notifications, ensuring an efficient order-processing pipeline.
- **AI/ML Core** - This module is the intelligence center, using AI and ML to interpret email content, learn from interactions, and enhance its ability to provide accurate and context-aware responses.
- **Networking & Communication** - It establishes and manages connections with email servers, ensuring secure and reliable communication for the swift exchange of emails.
- **Scheduling** - With the Scheduling module, GPT-Respond-Box can plan and execute automated email tasks, such as sending out marketing campaigns at peak times for optimal engagement.
- **Notification** - The Notification module alerts users about critical tasks, such as high-priority emails or follow-ups, maintaining user engagement and response timeliness.
- **Analytics and Reporting** - This module provides insights into email campaign performance, user interactions, and system effectiveness, helping users make informed decisions based on accurate data.
- **Content Management** - By managing a repository of response templates and marketing content, this module ensures that the GPT-Respond-Box conveys consistent and relevant information to customers.




## Detailed User Stories
GPT-Respond-Box is composed of the following user stories:

### 
<details>
    <summary>Story 4: As a user, I want to set up automatic email responses for certain tasks I manually predefine, such as sending invoices or booking confirmations.</summary>

- **Goal:** Automate pre-setup tasks based on email interactions
- **Modules:** AI/ML Core, Scheduling, Content Management

#### Workflow
1. Identify and classify incoming emails based on content and intent using the AI/ML Core module.
2. Based on predefined user settings, determine if the incoming email requires an automated action such as sending an invoice or booking confirmation.
3. Fetch required content (like invoice details or booking information) from the Content Management module.
4. Prepare an appropriate email response using Content Management module templates.
5. Schedule the prepared response for immediate or delayed delivery using the Scheduling module.
6. Send the response automatically to the sender.
7. Log the event and the response in the system for user's future review and potential analysis.

    User->>Content_Management: Request content for response
    Content_Management->>User: Provide content and templates
    User->>Scheduling: Schedule response delivery
    Scheduling->>User: Confirm response scheduled
    User->>AI_ML_Core: Send automatic email
    AI_ML_Core->>User: Log sent email
```
    
#### Milestones

#### Email Classification
- Develop functionality to parse incoming emails into a structured format for further processing.

- Implement AI algorithms to recognize the intent and content of parsed emails.



#### Automated Action Determination
- Create a rules engine to map recognized email intents to predefined user settings for automated actions.



#### Content Fetching
- Design mechanisms to retrieve specific content, such as invoices or booking details, required for the email response.



#### Response Preparation
- Develop the functionality to apply retrieved content to email templates to form proper email bodies.



#### Email Scheduling and Sending
- Incorporate scheduling options to send emails immediately or at a pre-defined time.

- Implement the process to automatically send out the scheduled emails.



#### Logging and Review
- Ensure that every email sent is logged within the system along with its details for review.
